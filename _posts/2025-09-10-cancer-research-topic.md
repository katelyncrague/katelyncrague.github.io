Cancer  type: Melanoma (skin cancer)


While this type of cancer is less common than other types, the frequency in 2025 is expected to increase by 5.9 percent.


This type of cancer can be indentified by a professional skin examination. It can be dectected by changes in skin appearence, color, or shape. Along with the pressence of abnormal moles.


Some factors that increase a person's risk for developing melanoma include excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) rays such as tanning beds or the sun. People with a lighter skin tone and history of sunburns may also be more vulnerable.


Melanoma has five stages. Stage 0 is when the cancer is only present in top layer of the skin. Stage 1 is when this cancer spreads deeper into the skin but not beyond. Stage 2 the cancer has grown thicker or spread to lymph nodes. Stage 3 the cancer spreads to regional lymph nodes but not the organs. Stage 4 the cancer has spread to distant organs such as the brain, liver, or lungs.


Some treatments for melanoma include surgery, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy.
The average life expectancy of someone with melanoma depends on the stage and severity. Early stages include a 99% life expectancy rate, while later more severe stages have a 16-27% expectancy rate.
